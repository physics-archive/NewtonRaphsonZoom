# NewtonRaphsonZoom
MATLAB code to generate Newton-Raphson fractals. Figures are rendered and exported in succession using export_fig toolbox.

##Usage
/exportfig/ must be added to MATLAB's path in order to run export_fig() within fractalRender.m. Alternatively, if the exportfig toolbox is globally installed, that is preferable.
